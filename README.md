# Personal portfolio Website

This is an incomplete portfolio website, designed to showcase my work and skills as a web developer. At the moment, only the home page has been created with the navigation, about, projects, and contact sections. The other pages have not been created yet 
## Tech Stack
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is designed to be fully responsive for optimal viewing on all devices.
## Future Development

I plan to continue working on this website as time permits. The next step is to create the projects section, which will showcase my past and current projects. I also plan to redesign the website to improve the overall user experience and make it more visually appealing.
## Contributing

This project is currently not open for contributions as it is a personal project. However, I appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have to improve the website.
